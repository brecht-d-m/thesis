# Hex.Bigboards.io

## Creating stack

To create a stack, go to [hive.bigboards.io](hive.bigboards.io). As a base, the Apache Spark stack was used (this can be forked). 

## Available hexes

There are two available hexes:
- curry
- thompson

These are available via: <name>.hex.bigboards.io:7000.

## Access from outside elis network

1. Setup vpn to UGent
2. `ssh -L 1070:curry.hex.bigboards.io:7000 <username>@ssh.elis.ugent.be`

Via this way, you can access the web interface of the hex. All the other ports are blocked by the UGent.
